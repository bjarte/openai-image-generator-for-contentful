# OpenAI image generator for Contentful

This is a demo app using OpenAI to generate images based on a text input.

Based on [OpenAI's quickstart example](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

## Setup

1. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

3. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
4. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
